First go to /reactexpress/server.js to Line 7 and change the details for your database.

Then start your server npm, and go to http://localhost:5000/createtabletasks to create the currect table.

Start npm and then enter reactexpress dir and start the server too.
then you are good to go, Hope we will be in touch.
